            The three teams in our city have come together (despite extreme athletic rivalry) by forming a group
            called the Lee's Summit R-7 Robotics Alliance. Its goal is to maintain a structured union among the
            three Lee's Summit robotics teams to ensure sustainability and coopertition. The Alliance works to
            create, promote, and support a marketing position and plan that effectively communicates the purposes,
            opportunities, and results of FIRST and the teams. This alliance is made up of ourselves (Team 1987),
            as well as Team 1730 (<a href="http://www.teamdriven.us/" target="_blank">Team Driven</a>),
            and Team 1986 (<a href="http://www.teamtitanium.org/" target="_blank">Team Titanium</a>).
        </p>

            The three teams share a build site at the R-7 Robotics Center built by the Lee's Summit School
            District. The teams work together to promote FIRST and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and
            Math) within our communities. These teams have done a variety of presentations such as the Missouri
            House of Representatives, the Lee's Summit City Council, and Downtown Days. They also host an annual
            open house. For the open house, all three teams open up their build sites and allow the community, as
            well as other teams, to come check out the build sites and the robots. The alliance allows these three
            teams to work together to promote gracious professionalism and coopertition, as well as spread the
            FIRST message to the community.

            The three Lee's Summit robotics teams build at the R-7 Robotics Center, a renovated facility on
            Lee's Summit District property. The center is comprised of individual space for each team, along with
            a large shared space that can be used for combined team dinners and practice.
