I"u<p>I have made a <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/bulma-clean-theme">theme for Jekyll</a> which is based on the Bulma frontend framework. It might look familiar, because I am also using it for this site. If you like the look of this theme then I thought I would write a little blog post about how to use it for your own site and how you can use it with GitHub Pages.</p>
