I"˜<p>Iâ€™ve been meaning to write about some of the new features I have been rolling out to my Jekyll theme, <a href="https://www.csrhymes.com/bulma-clean-theme/">Bulma Clean Theme</a>, for a while but I have only just managed to push the update for the landing page layout last weekend. This article provides some of the thinking behind the updates, as well as a brief introduction to how to get started.</p>
