The Lee's Summit Robotics Open House will be Sunday, Febuary 10th, opening our shop to all of Lee's Summit! 

Our Shop is at 7th and Browning, in "Robotics 2", behind the building inside of the parking lot. It is the first shop next to the Athletics Building. 

The other shops will be marked so you can see the other Lee's Summit teams shops too!

The Open House will run from 2-4pm, and you can get a good look at our progress on the season!
