Before the game reveal, the Broncobots host an annual pancake breakfast to celebrate the dawn of the build season. All three R7 Alliance teams show up to support our team.

After our pancake breakfast, all three R7 Alliance teams take a seat in the Performing Arts Center to watch the kickoff livestream.



Here's the Reveal:

We started brainstorming about strategy and robot design immediately after the game reveal. Strategy has won us competitions before, so we decided to spend a considerable amount of time discussing ways to win the game. 



On Monday, we finally made it into our shop. We began prototyping different types of cube manipulators and elevators.

We spent the rest of the week starting the CAD for the chasiss and using our CNC router and CNC mill to cut out prototypes quick and accurate.
