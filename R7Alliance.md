The three teams in our city have come together (despite extreme athletic rivalry) by forming the Lee's Summit R-7 Robotics Alliance. Its goal is to maintain a structured union among the three Lee's Summit robotics teams to ensure sustainability and coopertition. The alliance works to create, promote, and support a marketing position and plan that effectively communicates the purposes, opportunities, and results of FIRST and the teams. This alliance is made up of ourselves (Team 1987), as well as Team 1730 ([Team Driven](http://www.teamdriven.us/)), and Team 1986 ([Team Titanium](https://www.teamtitanium.org/)).

The three teams shared a building site on Lee's Summit High School campus from 2008 until 2023, when LSR7 sponsored new shops at each school. The teams promote FIRST and STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math) within our communities. These teams have done a variety of presentations together. They also host an annual open house. For the open house, all three teams open their build sites and allow the community and other teams to check out the build sites and the robots. The alliance enables these three teams to work together to promote gracious professionalism and coopertition and spread the FIRST message to the community.
