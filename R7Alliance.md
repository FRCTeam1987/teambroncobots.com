The three teams in our city have come together (despite extreme athletic rivalry) by forming a group called the Lee's Summit R-7 Robotics Alliance. Its goal is to maintain a structured union among the three Lee's Summit robotics teams to ensure sustainability and coopertition. The Alliance works to create, promote, and support a marketing position and plan that effectively communicates the purposes, opportunities, and results of FIRST and the teams. This alliance is made up of ourselves (Team 1987), as well as Team 1730 ([Team Driven](http://www.teamdriven.us/)), and Team 1986 ([Team Titanium](https://www.teamtitanium.org/)).

The teams work together to promote FIRST and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) within our communities. These teams have done a variety of presentations such as the Missouri House of Representatives, the Lee's Summit City Council, and Downtown Days. They also host an annual open house. For the open house, all three teams open up their build sites and allow the community, as well as other teams, to come check out the build sites and the robots. The alliance allows these three teams to work together to promote gracious professionalism and coopertition, as well as spread the FIRST message to the community.
